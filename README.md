# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of over 75,000 tweets, classifying them into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. The analysis is carried out using both machine learning and deep learning techniques.

# Key Features:
1. Data Preprocessing:             
  • Cleaned and preprocessed raw tweets by removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing tokenization.             
  • Converted text data into numerical form using TF-IDF and Word2Vec embeddings.            
2. Modeling:           
  • Built and optimized machine learning models like Random Forest and deep learning models like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for sentiment classification.           
  • Achieved high accuracy with both models:          
    --> ANN: 97% accuracy.                                      
    --> Random Forest: 93% accuracy.

# Libraries & Tools:
